# Getting Started

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save redux-actions
```

or

```bash
$ yarn add redux-actions
```

The [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) package provides a [CommonJS](http://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html) build for use in Node.js, and with bundlers like [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/). It also includes an [ES modules](http://jsmodules.io/) build that works well with [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org/) and [Webpack2](https://webpack.js.org)'s tree-shaking.

The [UMD](https://unpkg.com/redux-actions@latest/dist) build exports a global called `window.ReduxActions` if you add it to your page via a `<script>` tag. We _donâ€™t_ recommend UMD builds for any serious application, as most of the libraries complementary to Redux are only available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=redux).

## Usage

```js
import { createActions, handleActions, combineActions } from 'redux-actions';

const defaultState = { counter: 10 };

const { increment, decrement } = createActions({
  INCREMENT: (amount = 1) => ({ amount }),
  DECREMENT: (amount = 1) => ({ amount: -amount })
});

const reducer = handleActions(
  {
    [combineActions(increment, decrement)]: (
      state,
      { payload: { amount } }
    ) => {
      return { ...state, counter: state.counter + amount };
    }
  },
  defaultState
);

export default reducer;
```
