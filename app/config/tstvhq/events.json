            "description": "Historically, female vampires were portrayed as predatory lesbians or as subservient to a Master in the form of Dracula. They were the Brides, a means to bring victims to the male vampire. Modernized versions of the Brides have them liberated from any Master and are unconventional women fighting the patriarchy and the 'traditions' that try to keep them submissive. Through the films Bit (2019), Byzantium (2017), and Bliss (2019), we see the full spectrum of these women, we see the Rise of Carmilla.",
