You think you can see it, but you also notice the entrance to a cave. Strange markings are scratched in its walls, and a light emanates from inside. You creep closer. Within the cave, you can see an open book on a pedestal. The voice speaks from inside the cave. 'Knowledge is the greatest gift. You've come this far. Eat of the fruit and become as a god.'"
