## Contributing

### Prerequisites
This document assumes an environment with docker/docker-compose, with a user account able to interact with the daemon (*without* needing sudo).

### Running the app locally
```bash
make pull && make up && make db
```

The default app installation should now be running on localhost:443 with a self-signed certificate.

To allow self-signed certs for localhost in Chrome, toggle this debug flag: chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost

### Configuration

App configuration is done with a collection of JSON files in app/config.
`base/config.conf` is the root configuration, which is merged with/superceded by the values in `development.json` and `production.json` when in those respective environments.
`base/rooms.json` contains the room layout that is loaded into the database and used by all connected clients.

To use a custom configuration, symlink a `config.json` and/or `rooms.json` to `app/config/overrides/`.
`app/config/overrides/config.json` will be merged with/supercede the default configs, while `app/config/overrides/rooms.json` will completely replace the default rooms.

Advanced configuration for events (`overrides/events.json`) and image maps (`overrides/imagemaps.json`) are also supported.
// TODO document these

By convention, different installations of the application are stored as folders under `config/` e.g. `config/cabin-weekend`.

To set up your local build as one of the existing configurations, simply symlink that configuration's folder to `config/overrides`, then run `make clean-webpack && make webpack`

There is a helpful script that does all of this for you:
```bash
app/set_config.sh <name_of_config>
```

### Themes

The easiest way to style the app is to add a theme.
Themes live in `app/client/styles/themes`.
There is a default theme, which you can override by creating a symlink at `app/client/styles/themes/_active.scss`.

There is a helpful script that does all of this for you:
```bash
app/set_theme.sh <name_of_theme>
```

### Frontend development flow
When modifying (S)CSS or JS or HTML, you will need to rerun webpack, which is dockerized.

```bash
make webpack
```

Currently watch mode is not supported.

### Backend development flow
It's a bit overkill, but for now the simplest thing to do after modifying python code is to restart all containers:

```bash
make restart
```

### Changing configs
After changing configs with `app/set_config.sh`, you should rerun webpack and restart, then once the db is running reinitialize it:

```bash
make webpack && make restart; sleep 15; make db
```

### Changing themes
After changing themes with `app/set_theme.sh`, you should rerun webpack:

```bash
make webpack
```

### Updating npm dependencies
Node, npm, and its dependencies are all happily dockerized, so you shouldn't have to worry about this unless you are actually changing npm packages. If you are, you will need to build a new `node` image, and commit the resulting lock file changes. Ideally you would also push the new image, but permissions aren't available for this for most devs yet.

The following command will run the build and copy out the lockfile for you:

```bash
make npm-update
```

### Jitsi API documentation
API doc:
https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/doc/api.md

Definition of JitsiMeetExternalAPI():
https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/modules/API/external/external_api.js

Config options:
https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/config.js

Interface config options:
https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/interface_config.js

### A slightly irritating note
It seems like the Jitsi Meet library isn't intended to be consumed the way you'd use a regular JS library in a modern app, i.e., it seems you can't import it. We have to use a script tag to get it working, and then access the global variable:
```html
<body>
  ...
  <script src='https://meet.jit.si/external_api.js'></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/bundle.js"></script>
</body>
```

```javascript
// To use inside a React component
const JitsiAPI = window.JitsiMeetExternalAPI
```
